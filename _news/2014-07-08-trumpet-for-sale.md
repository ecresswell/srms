<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a mid-range instrument.&nbsp; It's been well used so the lacquer has been worn away in places, but it's in very good playing order and has been carefully looked after by it's one owner.&nbsp; It's even been played at Glastonbury!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're interested and would like to make an offer or would like more details, please contact Ian Holmes 07925 579984.</p>
