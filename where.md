<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We welcome children from aged 4 and upwards and offer the opportunity for them to create their own timetable from a range of musical and artistic activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We also offer the chance for enthusiastic parents to learn alongside their children!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Come and enjoy a tour and a taste of Music School by arriving at Reception on a Saturday morning between 9.30 and 11.00, preferably at the beginning of term. Then if you can&rsquo;t wait to begin ....... simply plan a morning that suits you, we will help you to fill in our Registration Form, you pay a term&rsquo;s fees and you&rsquo;re in!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />If you are unsure whether an activity would suit your needs we are happy to let you attend for two weeks free of charge !</p>
