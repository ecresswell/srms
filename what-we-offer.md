title: What we Offer
---

<h4 style="text-align: left;">SRMS  believes that children and adults of  all ages and abilities can benefit  from music&nbsp;activities, not only to  develop a life long interest in  many different types of music and to  acquire skills in singing, dancing  and playing an instrument but also to  build up their self-esteem and  confidence in their own abilities.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">We believe  that as far as possible no  individual student should be deprived of the  opportunity to benefit from  the School&rsquo;s activities because of their  social, physical or economic  circumstances.&nbsp; We are continually seeking  the financial and other  resources necessary to implement this  principle and to extend the  available opportunities as widely as  possible.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">We provide one-to-one tuition with experienced teachers on a wide range of instruments including strings, brass, saxophone, piano and keyboards, acoustic and electric guitar, recorders and voice.&nbsp; Lessons usually last for 30 minutes, but a 20 minute lesson may be advisable for those taking up a new instrument.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">The weekly timetable includes:</h4>
<p>Music theory.<br />Beginners and intermediate ukelele.<br />Beginners and intermediate recorder.;<br />Music makers.<br />Adult choir.</p>
<p>Dance and drama.<br />Art workshop runs for most of the morning with the chance for free, spontaneous creating!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>We also encourage our students to perform both together and individually at our Christmas and Summer Concerts.</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><br />At 11.00am we all meet for a well deserved cuppa or cold drink and sweets from our Tuck Shop.</h4>
